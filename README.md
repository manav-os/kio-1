**Overview**  
Kio is perfect for self-learners who value structure, variety, and the flexibility to learn at their own pace. Whether you’re in a rush and need a crash course or want an in-depth dive into a new subject, Kio has you covered.  

**Why the Need for Kio**  
Websites like The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp prove there's a market for text-based learning. But since they focus only on coding, we created **Kio** — a platform where you can learn *any* subject in the same way!  

**How We Built It**  
- Used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Llama-3.3-70B, and Groq.  

**Challenges We Faced**  
- Finding a suitable API for free  
- Creating our own parsing function as the JavaScript parse function didn’t work  
- API taking too long to generate courses, leading to gateway crashes  

**Lessons Learned**  
- Learned Git and GitHub  
- Mastered the integration of AI into websites to ensure a smooth user experience  

**Future Scope**  
- Add a Q&A feature  
- Add images relevant to the courses  
- Integrate a sandbox to make it more interactive
