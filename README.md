**Overview**
Kio is perfect for self-learners who value structure, variety, and the flexibility to learn at their own pace. Whether you’re in a rush and need a crash course or want an in-depth dive into a new subject, Kio has you covered.

**Why the need for Kio**
Websites like The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp prove there's a market for text-based learning. But since they focus only on coding, we created **kio** — a platform where you can learn *any* subject in the same way!

**How We Built It**
- Used Next.Js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Llama-3.3-70B, and Groq.

**Challenges We Faced**
- finding a suitable api for free
- create own parsing function as js parse function didn't work
- API taking too long to generate course leading to gateway crash

  **Lesson Learnt**
  -Learnt git and git hub
  -mastered integration of Ai into websites to ensure a smooth user experience

  **Future Scope**
  -add Q&A feature
  -add images relevant to the course
  -integrate sandbox to make it more interactive
